    excerpt: "Everything in Python is an object.  We'll explore the basic types using the [turtle tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtledemo) as it has stood the test of time.  It is also interesting to engage with objects by interactively building something with them.  The complex pattern above is a classical example based on a BYTE magazine article from 1982."

    excerpt: "Python is extremely well supported by a vibrant open source community.  Not only is it the lingua franca of data science but arguably the second best languge for everything else.  'Think of data science not as a new domain of knowledge to learn, but a new set of skills that you can apply within your current area of expertise.' ~ [Jake VanderPlas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)"
