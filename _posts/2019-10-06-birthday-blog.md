I've decided to start a blog for the fun stuff I get up to.  For my birthday I'm going on a hike from Falls Lake to Bond lake.  I'm going to try out the new [Blackbird hammock](https://youtu.be/0jU8mzz3xJk).  Here's the route I'm going to attempt.  I start this evening Sunday October 6th 2019.  I'll hopefully get to Bond lake on Friday or Saturday morning.  I've never hiked this far before.  I've never solo camped for more than one night and I've certainly never done a fasted hike before.  I've [alternate day fasting](https://www.dietdoctor.com/intermittent-fasting) for a couple months.  In the last week I did [OMAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHdoAhZyP3I).  After leg of lamb and birthday cake today I'll be water fasting until the end of the hike.

Here's the [route:](http://www.wandermap.net/en/route/3608595-falls-lake-to-bond-lake/)
